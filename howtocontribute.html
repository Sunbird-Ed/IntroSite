              member can fill up the form available on the building block microsite to nominate for the membership of
              working group</p>
            <h6>How to communicate with the working group?</h6>

              Any community member can bring in a need and anyone can develop or implement the need. From initiation of
              a need to its development and implementation, the community collaborates to align on the need, its design,
              development, testing and release etc. The contributions can come in several ways during this change

            <h2 id="toc_7_1" class="pt-5">1.Contributing by actively engaging with the community</h2>
            <p>The discussion forum is the only communication tool for the building block where the community members
              would reach out for any information they need related to the building block. Request for information could
              be but not limited to below areas:-</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Technical, functional or process related</li>

            <p>Any need i.e. bugs, documentation issues, installation issues, new feature idea and enhancement idea for
              a new feature etc., ideally should be brought in the discussion forum for alignment with the community.
              Once the community aligns then the need has to be added into the issue tracker which becomes a backlog to
              be taken up for implementation</p>
            <p>Below are the issue type available in the issue tracker to capture the needs:-</p>
            <ol class="pb-4">
              <li>Bugs - Something that isn’t working as intended. </li>
              <li>Minor enhancements - Suggestions to improve existing features</li>
              <li>Documentation issues - Report documentation related issues</li>
              <li>Installation issues - Installation related issues. </li>
              <li>RFC - For New Feature or Major Enhancements.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="fw-bold">Before bringing up a need in the discussion forum, contributor(s) are recommended to
              follow the below steps</p>
            <ol class="pb-4">
              <li>Search the discussion forum as well as issue tracker for any similar items to avoid duplication</li>
              <li>Check if the issue can be replicated in the latest version of the product</li>

            <h2 id="toc_7_4" class="pt-5">Issue Workflow</h2>
            <p>The below diagram captures a very high level workflow of how an issue flows between various stages.</p>
              <img src="http://via.placeholder.com/640x360" alt="" title="" />
            </div>

              <div>
            <h2 id="toc_7_5" class="pt-5">How to start ?</h2>
           
            <p>Every Building block publishes their list of issues with the latest status in the issue tracker and the link for the same is available on the microsite as well as discussion forum landing page. The issues that are not yet taken up for development are published as a backlog of issues on the issue tracker and the link for the same is available on the microsite. The issues in the backlog are available to be taken up for development</p>
            <p>Every issue will have a complexity field which will give a sense of ease or difficulty involved in developing the issues. The issues will also have a Priority field which will give a sense of urgency of developing the issue. Both these fields will help in identifying the appropriate issue to be picked up for development.</p>
            <p>Below are the complexity levels.The level names are self explanatory but the detail definition of each of the complexity level can be found on the building block’s microsite</p>

            <ol class="pb-4">
              <li>Good for First time contribution</li>
              <li>Simple</li>
              <li>Medium</li>
              <li>Complex</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Below are the priority levels. The highest priority level (most urgent issues) start from P1 and the urgency decreases are the priority number increases. The Priority levels will be assigned by the working group and the criteria for the same will be detailed on the BB’s microsite</p>

            <ol class="pb-4">
              <li>P1 - highest priority needs to be taken up in next 24 hrs (hotfix) in cases of a bug OR immediate release for other issue type</li>
              <li>P2 - To be taken up in or before the next stable release</li>
              <li>P3 - Part of the roadmap</li>
              <li>Not Assigned yet- Not planned yet in the roadmap</li>
            </ol>

          <p>Once an issue is picked up for development, updating the status of the issue by the contributor in the issue tracker is very important as it keeps the community updated on the latest status of the issue. It also helps to plan the testing and other release related activities.</p>

            <p>The next section has the details of the different steps and the related activities in each step of development </p>
            
            <p>Once the development is completed by the contributor, the changes are finally validated and tested by the community QA team to sign-off the changes for inclusion in the latest version of the building block. Any issues found during this testing has to be fixed by the contributor and validated by the QA team within the published release timelines

          <ul class="pb-4">
            <li>The test cases and results are to be shared with the QA community as per the template provided by the Building Block. The test cases need to be shared before creating a review and merge request. The test result should be documented and shared before updating the status of the issue to “In Validation”. The template for the same can be found on the building block microsite</li>
            <li>The contributor QA team should also plan to contribute towards the release testing of the changes developed by them as per the release testing process</li>
            <li>The contributor has to ensure that the code merge and the defect fixes happen as per the release timeline. Incase the issue is not completed as per the release timeline then the changes needs to be reverted back and a fresh PR request needs to be raised to revert the code changes</li>
            <li>The issue will be tested by community QA Team for the release sign-off as well as its status updated as “Done” post successful completion of release testing</li>
